# chat_app

Project made for NTP classes at Rzeszow University of Technology. 
As a server I used https://github.com/nihalsharma/DummyChat.
App is made for desktop in fact that server uses Sockets, so client also needs to rely on it and in Dart Socket class is available only for Windows.
For now user registration's made in connection with server, but message exchange is made locally.
